# Arduino_projects
 This is a folder with my Arduino projects. 
 The most interesting of them is this:
 - [Shift register clock](https://github.com/TerminatorNemo/Arduino/tree/main/Chas_bez_dc1302_FIXed) One of my first serious projects. A printed circuit board was developed for this watch.
 - [AyrSoftBomb](https://github.com/TerminatorNemo/Arduino/tree/main/AyrSoftBomb) Timer with 3 modes of operation. For playing airsoft. [Video with instructions for the 1st version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADUwG_yn8EQ)
 - Radio controlled aircraft, [Transmitter code](https://github.com/TerminatorNemo/Arduino/tree/main/tx_servo_peredacha_camolet_pylt_2.6), [Receiver code](https://github.com/TerminatorNemo/Arduino/tree/main/rx_servo_priom_camoleta_zashita_Potera_svazi_2.6_serial_print)
